# .NET Notts IoT
## nanoFramework and LegoNXT hacking
Code and materials to accompany the .NET nanoFramework presentation by myself and [Jose Simoes](https://github.com/josesimoes)https://github.com/josesimoes on 16th Nov 2023

-----

What's in this repo:

For starters everything I've been able to find that was publically available from Lego, such as the software dev kits and the hardware dev kits.

I'll also add the code I was going through, and a copy of my slides.

That's all for a beginning, but I will add anything I can find extra as time goes on, and hopefully Jose will too.
